# Augmented Art



An Augmented Reality Art App project brings art to life. Allows users to interact and learn more about brilliant art pieces.

Our app currently works with Kandinsky's Composition VIII. Using an Android phone or laptop camera this canvas from Kandinsky pops and animates right out in front of you like it has literally come to life!

# Technologies used

- Unity 3D

- Vuforia

- C#

- iTween native Unity extention

- Adobe Illustrator

- Blender

- Unity Testing Framework ()

- Android Studio



## About some of these technologies:



**Unity** is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies and used to develop video games for PC, consoles, mobile devices and websites.

A multi platform game development tool with customizable and easy to use editor, graphical pipelines to DirectX and OpenGL, advanced physics engine, 2D and 3D physics, C# and JavaScript scripting, built in code editor,

Native Visual Studio integration and more.



**Vuforia** is the World’s most widely deployed AR platform. Vuforia delivers best-in-class computer vision, ensuring robust and reliable experiences in a variety of environments. It offers developers the creative freedom to build unique experiences that reflect brands and drive business results. Supports leading phones, tablets and digital eyewear across Android, iOS and UWP. Can recognize a range of everyday images, objects and environments.



**Blender** is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation.



**iTween** is a simple, powerful and easy to use animation system for Unity. iTween is a single C# file that can be used with ANY of the programming languages that Unity supports, as well as all versions of Unity.





## Process during development

- Research & defining technical requirements
- Delegate responsibilities
- TDD, Agile principles
- Art piece selection based on Vuforia trackability rating
- Adobe Illustrator—created 2D graphics
- Blender—Converted 2D graphics to 3D Models
- Unity—Wrote C# scripts to animate 3D models & built app architecture
- Vuforia—Enabled app to see Kandinsky’s art and augment animation via device camera
- NUnit Testing Framework for C# animation scripts
- Build and deploy app to android device
- Retros and stand ups
- Refactoring
- Presentation at Maker's Academy



## Future directions


Deploy to iOS

See this app used in real art spaces

Galleries, Museums will be interested to have another feature attract, educate, and engage visitors with augmented art pieces

We would like to implement video record button so users can film themselves interacting with the live art

At the moment our app is not an actual Android app, only an android build of the original application. This would be costly to provide at this point, but definitely something to consider in the future
